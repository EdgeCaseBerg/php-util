PHP Util
=======================================================================

This is just some code in PHP that I use for backend stuff sometimes,
it's generic and helpful code that makes my job a little easier. 


Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Set up your database, and for any entities you define, give them a pk 
column called id. Next, define your `CONFIG_FILE_PATH` to a json file
set up like conf.sample.json, include the init.php file and you'll be
ready to go.

Check the doc file for more information.
